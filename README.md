# Hey, I'm Aditya 👋

I'm a Data Science & CS student at Pitt, and I spend most of my time at the intersection of **machine learning, quantitative modeling, and signal processing**. I like building things that actually work end-to-end — messy raw data in, something useful out.

Right now I'm deep into time-series forecasting, Bayesian modeling, and anything involving NLP or LLMs. I also have a soft spot for quant finance and wearable health tech.

## 🔨 Things I've Built

### 📈 Apple Stock Price Prediction
A quantitative ML pipeline that predicts next-day AAPL returns using 80+ engineered technical indicators across 15 years of price data. Strict chronological validation (no leakage), return-based targets to avoid price-range bias, and **58–62% out-of-sample directional accuracy on 2023–2024 data**.

### 🫀 Textile ECG Signal Classifier
End-to-end pipeline for classifying ECG signals from textile-based biosensors. The real challenge here was dealing with noisy physiological time-series — extracting clean features from wearable sensors that aren't exactly lab-grade hardware.

### 🦠 COVID-19 Multi-City Analytics
Built a data ingestion and visualization pipeline tracking case trends across 50+ U.S. cities. Automated ETL, time-series trend analysis, and interactive dashboards — built when the data was actually moving fast and accuracy mattered.

---

### 🧪 Materials Efficiency Analyzer
Regression modeling pipeline for analyzing filtration material performance, built as part of research on advanced materials and biosensing. Took experimental lab data from raw measurements to interpretable efficiency predictions.
